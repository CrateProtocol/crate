Crate Protocol allows anyone to create, manage, and trade a tokenized basket of assets, which we refer to as a **Crate**. A Crate is always fully collateralized by its underlying assets. The protocol will evolve to support advanced features, including automatic rebalancing based on set parameters.

We're in active development. For the latest updates, please join our community:
